This project was made for a company using `RitwikGA/FacebookReportingTool` to export daily, weekly, monthly facebook ads.
The project runs on script.google.com and exports and saves these fields for each campaign in a spreadsheet:
* Start Date
* End Date
* Locale
* Campaign name
* Cost
* Impressions
* Clicks
* Avg. pos.
* Number of new trial users
* Number of new paying users

At the end of each export, the exported data is also sent to a Slack channel.
